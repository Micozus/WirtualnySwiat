## WirtualnySwiat - mini game
######  HomeWork task in [https://sdacademy.pl/](https://sdacademy.pl/) "Java od Podstaw" course

Game/App was first real challenge in both designing and programming Java Application from scratch.
Task was designed to train OOP and object's relations in the early stages of the programming course.

Looking at this project from time perspective I must say that I'd do everything differently :) - Especially spaghetti methods in classes and reflection using but I like to keep it that way to see what progress was mad since then.
